# Fire-and-smoke-detection-using-yolov9
This is to test newly launched yolov9 model by fine tuning it to detect fire and smoke in the image or video feed.
It is just trained on 11 epoch, but got promising results with 87% mAP value, which could be further improved, it uses 46% less compute power compared to yolov8
